# High-precision numbers

Based on an idea from an article "A Floating-Point Technique for Extending the Available Precision", published by T. J. Dekker in 1971.

High-precision number is stored as a pair of doubles - value and small correction. 
Effective mantissa size becomes twice more than in double number.
